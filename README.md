# card-carousel
Simple carousel view program.

~~To rotate counter-clockwise, hold down your left mouse button; for clockwise, hold the right mouse button. To view from debug view, hit the down arrow; to go back, hit the up arrow.~~

~~Presently this program displays well, but has a slight error with the rendering of the cards most apparent from 
the debugging view. Updates to follow.~~

Previous bugs have been fixed and features have been added with the latest update; also, dependence on boost has been removed.

**New Features:**

- Add Card        : Hit the 'a' key
- Remove Card     : Hit the 'r' key
- Show # of Cards : Hit the 'i' key
- Show Card Data  : Hit the 'v' key
- Toggle Rotation : Hit the space bar

Also, the rotation control scheme has changed slighty: to rotate counter-clockwise, click your left mouse button; to rotate clockwise, click your right mouse button.

Enjoy!
