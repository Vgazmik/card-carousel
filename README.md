# card-carousel
Simple carousel view program, needs slight modification.

To rotate counter-clockwise, hold down your left mouse button; for clockwise, hold the right mouse button.
To view from debug view, hit the down arrow; to go back, hit the up arrow.

Presently this program displays well, but has a slight error with the rendering of the cards most apparent from 
the debugging view. Updates to follow.
